## My Frontend Path Project 😺
This project will allow me to have a single source of thruth of all JS concepts I've been learning about. These items will contain basic theory written by me about how the concept actually works and behave in different scenarios.

### Html and JS 👩‍💻
Each concept live inside their own folder, containing files and a description for each of them. I believe that having the code and description in the same place, will help me out on getting future references and gathering new info together.
